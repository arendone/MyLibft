# MyLibft
In this project I write my own library (It is included ft_printf)

## ft_printf
I recoded the original function printf.
### Considered conversions: 
• %c print a single character.
• %s print a string of characters.
• %p The void * pointer argument is printed in hexadecimal.
• %d print a decimal (base 10) number.
• %i print an integer in base 10.
• %u print an unsigned decimal (base 10) number.
• %x print a number in hexadecimal (base 16), with lowercase.
• %X print a number in hexadecimal (base 16), with uppercase.
• %% print a percent sign.
### Considered flags:
• Manage any combination of the following flags: ’-0.’ and minimum field width
with all conversions
• Manage all the following flags: ’# +’ (yes, one of them is a space)
